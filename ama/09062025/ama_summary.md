## Core Investment Philosophy

### Fundamental DeFi Instruments (80% of Capital)
**Lending Markets:**
- [Aave](https://aave.com) - Leading decentralized lending protocol for borrowing and lending crypto assets
- [Compound](https://compound.finance) - Algorithmic money market protocol for earning interest on deposits
- [Morpho](https://morpho.org) - Peer-to-peer lending optimizer built on top of Aave and Compound
- [Fluid](https://fluid.instadapp.io) - Smart debt protocol with automated position management
- [Euler Finance](https://www.euler.finance) - Modular lending protocol with customizable risk parameters

**DEXs:**
- [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) - Largest decentralized exchange using automated market maker model
- [Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance) - Base network's central liquidity hub and DEX
- [Balancer](https://balancer.fi) - Automated portfolio manager and decentralized exchange

**Perpetual DEXs:**
- [GMX](https://gmx.io) - Decentralized perpetual exchange with up to 50x leverage

### Risk Management Principles
1. **Don't chase "secret strategies"** - They don't exist and won't earn more money
2. **Master fundamentals first** - Before exploring new instruments
3. **Limit exposure** - Use tested protocols with proven track records
4. **Think long-term** - Treat DeFi capital like rental property in digital format

## Current Market Strategies

### Stablecoin Strategies (12-15% APY)
1. **[Pendle Finance](https://app.pendle.finance/trade/markets/0x6d98a2b6cdbf44939362a3e99793339ba2016af4/swap?view=pt&chain=ethereum)**: 16% fixed yield on USDE for 18 days - Yield tokenization protocol for fixed income
2. **[Fluid](https://fluid.io/multiply/1) Looping**: With wstUSR/USDC pairs - Leveraged yield farming strategy
3. **[Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xbc6736d346a5ebc0debc997397912cd9b8fae10a&marketName=proto_mainnet_v3) Looping**: Using principal tokens, 3 loops can achieve ~18% yield - Recursive borrowing for enhanced yields

### Key Strategy Insights
- **Bitcoin/ETH as collateral**: Never use directly in liquidity pools without lending markets to avoid missing market growth
- **Health Factor Management**: Critical for leveraged positions
- **Wide vs Narrow Ranges**: Prefers wide ranges for stability over narrow ranges with higher theoretical APY

## Important Warnings

### Projects to Avoid
- Unaudited protocols launched recently
- Protocols with TVL but no proven track record
- Any protocol outside the fundamental list without deep understanding

### Common Mistakes
1. **Calculating yield only on borrowed amount** - Forgetting that collateral (BTC/ETH) also appreciates
2. **Chasing marginally higher yields** - Taking 10x risk for 10% more yield
3. **Not backtesting strategies** - $50 across 5 networks provides valuable data
4. **Following strategies blindly** - Without understanding personal financial goals

## Practical Advice

### Strategy Testing Approach
- Allocate $10 per network for testing
- Test on Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, Optimism
- Use identical ranges and timing
- Monitor for extended periods for objective data

### Personal System Development
Each investor needs to consider:
- Risk tolerance
- Monthly income
- Financial goals
- Withdrawal needs
- Time availability

## Q&A Highlights

### On Security
- Bunny and Delta Prime hacks discussed - neither were Tier 1 protocols
- UST collapse mentioned as learning experience
- Emphasis on sticking to battle-tested protocols

### On New Opportunities
- [Arbitrum DRIP](https://arbitrumdrip.com) program: 40M in rewards but yields already compressed - L2 scaling solution incentive program
- [Linea](https://linea.build) Ignition: ~11% total yield including token rewards - zkEVM L2 liquidity mining program
- Various new perpetual DEXs emerging but sticking with GMX recommended

### On Tools
- [Meteora](https://meteora.ag) pools analyzer link provided for Solana - Dynamic liquidity market maker on Solana
- [Kamino Finance](https://kamino.finance) - Solana automated liquidity management protocol mentioned for SOL strategies
- Emphasis on using native tools (Uniswap, Aave) interfaces
- Backtesting essential before major capital deployment

## Final Message
Ivan emphasizes teaching people to "fish" rather than giving them fish - the goal is for academy members to develop their own systems for capital management that work for their specific situations, allowing them to:
- Grow capital steadily
- Improve quality of life
- Have free time
- Feel secure about asset safety
- Make independent, informed decisions

The upcoming CGS module will provide the framework for this systematic approach to DeFi investing.
